# Prime_Numbers_Symmetrical_Distributions_Patterns with Python

The prime numbers hold many mysteries for mathematicians and computer engineers.

I have used Ulman's spiral (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral) but 
my spiral has a space in the core with a 10^2 square as seen in the excel file.

By using the python codes that are given in this file, we can find big prime numbers with the symmetrical patterns.
